# Four-in-a-Row-Python
Connect four in a row game - Course Assigment (brief at bottom)

Program when executed can be played in single player mode against python or against another user.
A simple game state save file can be used to pause and load previous games

There is commented TODO lists to add extra featuers, eg grid size

The menu crashes with “IndexError: list index out of range” when I tried to quit but 
I think this is a minor issue

Coding was done utilising the SUBLIME 3 IDE 


Assignment
Connect Four is a two-player board game where players take turns dropping 
their pieces into a 6x7 grid. The pieces fall straight down, landing on the lowest 
unoccupied space in the column. The first player to form a horizontal, vertical 
or diagonal line of four with their pieces wins the game.
For more details on the game, you can view the Wikipedia article here:
